description=SCENARIOS:
description=Entering Knox County Challenge - You are arriving on the outskirts of Knox County with a random amount of gas in your vehicle.
description=TODO - add random condition of vehicle
description=
description=Hospital Wake Up Challenge - You wake up drugged, hungry, thirsty, groggy, and with a broken bone!  You are only wearing a hospital gown, perfect for the modern classic "Wake up after the apocalypse" roleplay.
description=
description=(Almost) Naked and Afraid - Who knows how you ended up this way, but you wake up with no clothes and you're terrified out of your mind in a vacant property or cabin.
description=
description=Abandoned Soldier - Your squad never showed up and all of that gunfire you heard must have attracted a nearby horde.  You have decent gear, supplies and some empty/full magazines in your backpack.
description=
description=Prison Challenge - Start in your cell with a potentially zombified cellmate, and a random tool they smuggled in for you. Escape with your life!
description=
description=Last Ditch Security -  Start in March Ridge Dormitory on the 2nd floor with the 1st floor stairs removed.
description=
description=The Final Flight - Start as a crash landed aircraft pilot with some injuries, but also your emergency supplies.
description=
description=FIre Sale - Start in the middle of the mall, but a number of electrical fires break out.  Mall alarm will potentially go off.
